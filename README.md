Aneurysms
=========

Source code for finding intersections between two lines :) with a working example, used for my dissertation regarding aneurysms. Thorough documentation is not available but i would compile them all into one soon enough :)

Thorough commenting and coding is under process. Also, hope they are useful for other programming needs as well.
Do leave a message about changes that need to be done for efficiency and getting cleaner solutions.

Also, this is open source if at all in doubt :)
